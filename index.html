                        services with competitive prices and long <a href="contact.html">hours</a> for those who cannot always take care of their 
                        pet in the way they need, whether that be because of age, a physical disability, a busy schedule, or a lack of resources. 
                        The <a href="about.html">staff</a> at Puppy Spa & Play are determined to give each pet the love they deserve and do not 
                        discriminate against breed, age, or background. Our clients can rely on us for reliable pet care during the workday and 
                        for their pets to leave with softer fur than they came in with. Just see what our <a href="#testimonials">satisfied customers</a>
