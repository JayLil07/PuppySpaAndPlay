            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <img src="images/PawPrint.png" alt="A paw print" class="icon">
            <p>Here at Puppy Spa & Play, we aim to give each pet a safe and loving home away from home. 
                It is by no means easy to take care of a pet, and may be extra difficult due to personal reasons, 
                which is why we want to help take a load off of your back by expertly grooming your pet 
                and giving them a place to stay with healthy food, lots of socialization, and long walks. 
                The staff here are dedicated to the cause and love animals just as much as we do. 
                See what they have to say about themselves!</p>
