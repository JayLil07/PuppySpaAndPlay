            <summary>How Long Will It Take For My Pet To Get Groomed?</summary>

        <details>
            <summary>How Long Can I Keep My Pet at the Daycare?</summary>
            You can keep your pet in the daycare for any specified amount of time between 8 am and 6 pm. For an additional 
            price, accommodations can be made if your pet must be cared for outside of those hours. If you fail to receive 
            your pet within 15 minutes of your booked time, you will be charged a penalty of $30 per hour.
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What If My Pet Doesn't Like Other Animals?</summary>
            Pets are automatically separated by animal type when placed in the daycare. There are a limited amount of 
            private rooms for pets who do not get along with other animals, but if possible, they would be grouped with 
            their animal type. Please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> for more information about private rooms, their 
            availability, and if your pet is eligible to be in a private room.

        <details>
            <summary>What Is Your Vaccination Policy?</summary>
            For our grooming services, we require at the very least proof of vaccination for rabies for cats and dogs. 
            For our daycare services, we require your pet be up to date with all their vaccinations with proof from their vet. 
            For this reason, we don't accept animals under 6 months old.
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What Is Your Cancellation Policy?</summary>

            With notice, you are welcome to bring your own products or food if you're worried about allergies or contamination. 
            For a small fee, we will make the accommodations for you if you let us know of any restrictions your pet may have.
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Can I Stay With My Pet During The Grooming Session?</summary>
            For sanitary reasons, it is recommended you wait outside during most grooming sessions. However, if your package 
            does not include bathing your pet, you are welcome to stay with your pet during their session.
